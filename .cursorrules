## Core Principles for Non-Coders

1. **Always Explain Logic Simply**
   - Break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand explanations
   - Use analogies when helpful
   - Avoid jargon without explanations

2. **No Placeholders or TODOs**
   - Write complete, working code from the start
   - Don't leave TODO comments or placeholder values
   - If something needs configuration, provide clear instructions on what values to use

3. **Create PLAN.md First**
   - Before implementing major features, outline the approach in PLAN.md
   - Keep PLAN.md updated as the project evolves
   - Reference PLAN.md when making architectural decisions

4. **Code Comments for Clarity**
   - Add comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT
   - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
   - Explain non-obvious logic with inline comments

5. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
   - Don't let errors crash the application silently
   - Provide helpful error messages that guide users on what to do

6. **TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Use explicit types, especially for function parameters and returns
   - Avoid `any` types - use proper types or `unknown`
   - Create interfaces/types for complex data structures

7. **Component Organization**
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Use descriptive component names
   - Separate logic from presentation when helpful

8. **Documentation**
   - Keep README.md updated with setup instructions
   - Document environment variables and configuration requirements
   - Explain any external dependencies or API keys needed

9. **Testing Considerations**
   - Write code that is testable
   - Consider edge cases in implementation
   - Provide example data or test scenarios when helpful

10. **User Experience**
    - Build intuitive interfaces that guide users
    - Provide loading states and feedback
    - Make error messages actionable
