I am a non-coder building 'The Forge,' an AI-driven assignment synthesizer. We are using Next.js 15 (App Router), Vercel AI SDK, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

Objective: Create a foundation where I can upload or reference a 'knowledge base' (PDFs/Text) to generate nuanced case studies.

Tasks:

Initialize a clean Next.js project with TypeScript.

Create a .cursorrules file to ensure you always follow best practices for non-coders (explain logic simply, don't use placeholders, create a PLAN.md first).

Create a PLAN.md at the root that outlines our 3-phase roadmap:

Phase 1: Knowledge Base Ingestion (Local folder + Vector indexing).

Phase 2: Synthesis Engine (Generating the assignment and rubric).

Phase 3: Grading & Multi-modal Feedback.

Set up a folder called /knowledge_base where I can drop my PDFs.

Build a basic homepage with a search bar and a 'Generate Assignment' button using shadcn/ui.

Please start by outlining the PLAN.md and then proceed to the code once I approve."
